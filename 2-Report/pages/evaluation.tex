\chapter{Evaluation}
% Analyse on expressions instead of statements.
% Statements that contain a block should have not been split as this makes reconstruction very difficult.
\todo{Rewrite this entire paragraph.} Evaluating the success of my solution is difficult. My implemented solution only works for some examples, and its focus is on parallelising as much as possible, not necessarily getting a faster program. Also, many research papers in the field compare their speedup to LLVM, but rust (like many new langauges) uses LLVM itself. Making a pure comparison between the two is impossible, and so my result may be skewed.

\section{Limitations/Improvements}
My implementation to the problem does not work for all sequential programs.
