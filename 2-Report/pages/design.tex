\chapter{Design}
This chapter covers the basic design concepts of my parallelising compiler without fully realising the details of the compiler itself. Parallelising compilers described in the literature are split into several stages. Similarly, the design of my compiler is in two main stages, the analysis stage and the modification stage. Both these stages contain several steps to achieve their goal. The analysis stage looks at each function in the source code and tries to find parts that could be parallelised. The modification stage takes the parts that can be parallelised and changes the source code so that they run in parallel.
