\chapter{Discussion}
\section{Achievements}
\todo{Deals with inter-weaved programs pretty well, as long as they use features implemented}


\section{Improvements}
\todo{Deal with unsafe, non Send traits, mutable/immutable, etc.}

\todo{Immutable variables should be cloned, instead of moved/synchronised across threads. Increases memory usage, but would increase program speed}

\todo{Manage number of threads being used}

\todo{Combine threads together when it is not worth it to parallelise.}


\section{Approach Changes}
\todo{Expression level parallelisms}

\todo{Work with HIR instead so I don't have to deal with as much syntax sugar}
