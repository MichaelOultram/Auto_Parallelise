\chapter{Conclusion}
The problem that I wanted to tackle was automatically converting sequential source code into a parallelised program. This is a hard problem which is well established in the field of computer science. A literature review was included as part of this report, but due to the size of the field, it is no where near complete. It was very unlikely that I could further the research in this field with the amount of time I had.

The solution I chose was to use a compiler plugin which had the downside that I had to deal with all of the syntax sugar. This dramatically increased the number of cases I had to deal with, and not all of them were dealt with correctly.
